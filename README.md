# Spacemacs colors for VS Code (Dark & Light)

All credit where it is due, the real work was done by the wonderfull people of [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org)

Themes both include workbench and terminal styling.

## Additional settings, packages, etc.
In my attempt to get things looking as much as spacemacs as possible there are some none theme things i've added.
Below are all parts used in the screenshots.

 - [Source Code Pro Font](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro)
 - [Rainbow Brackets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=2gua.rainbow-brackets)
 - Seti icons (default available, enable with ```"workbench.iconTheme": "vs-seti", ``` in your config)
